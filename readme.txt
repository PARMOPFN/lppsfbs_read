Reading LPPS/FBS data from the non blocking socket (on linux system).
These files are a part of different project and it's very possible they can't be compiled as is without some effort.
There are a lot of project specific  "ass covers" and "stubbed" things completely non neccesary in real life.
Only for demonstration how to read frames from TCP non blocking socket and how to concatenate them
even if one (or more) frames are fragmented between different "recv" sesion.
